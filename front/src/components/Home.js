        <p className="marginleftright">Hello! My name is Dr. Sara Grunert. I am the founder and owner of Chiro Delivered. I attended Texas Womanâ€™s University on a gymnastics scholarship. After I graduated from TWU, I attended Parker University in Dallas and received my Doctorate of Chiropractic, as well as certification in soft tissue work (Facial Distortion Model).</p>
        <p className="marginleftright">I pursued a career as a Chiropractor because of the benefits I experienced from receiving chiropractic care both as a young girl who suffered from severe ear infections and as a competitive gymnast who suffered major injuries resulting in two knee surgeries and one back surgery. As a working professional, I continue to see the benefits of chiropractic care in maintaining my overall health and meeting my health goals.</p>
        <p className="marginleftright">Prior to founding Chiro Delivered, I worked in an integrated practice where I was able to continue to expand my knowledge base by working with medical doctors, doctors of osteopathy, and other chiropractors. I also gained valuable experience in adjusting, soft tissue work, and physiotherapy.</p>
        <p className="marginleftright">Outside of work, you will find me cheering on my hometown Chicago Blackhawks or enjoying a glass of wine in the company of my friends and family (which includes my two pups, Louie and Sally).</p>
        <br/>
        <p className="marginleftright"><b>Why Mobile/In Home Care?</b></p>
        <br/>
        <p className="marginleftright">One thing that we all have in common is that we are short on time. When I was practicing in a brick and mortar clinic, one complaint I often heard from patients was that they struggled to find time to attend their appointments. Even a thirty minute appointment would consume an hour or two of their day. This is why I started Chiro Delivered. Instead of my patients taking time away from work or their families to sit in traffic or a waiting room, I come to them to provide care and help achieve their health goals.</p>
